-had node.js installed to use "npm"
  -check installation:
  in the CMD run:
node -v
and then:
npm -v
(if there isn't info of the version installed you need to install it)

-create index.html
-a 'css' folder
-a 'main-custom.css' file [for your custom css]
(the name you like, but in root/project folder like the index, or where you like but be aware to specify your right path in step 5)




1- install the 'package.json' deppendency administrator for the project:
 -go with the CMD to the your project folder
 -run: npm init -y


2- now run: 
npm install tailwindcss --save -dev


3- create your tailwind config file (yes, it's npX)
 - run: npx tailwind init
(it will create the tailwind.config.js file)


4- add tailwind to your css file these lines:
(we named it: main-custom.css)

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


5- process your css with tailwind to a new css file
(we will store the new file in our 'css' folder)
run:
"npx tailwind build styles.css -o output.css"
IN OUR CASE:
npx tailwind build main-custom.css -o css/tailwind.css


6- then in your html don't forget you links, for this example must look like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tailwind.css">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="main-custom.css">
(this link shouldn't )

npx tailwind build main-custom.css -o css/tailwind.css

	AND WE ARE READY
